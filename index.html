  <h2 id="one">American Curl</h3>
  <p>The distinctive feature of the American Curl is their attractive, uniquely curled-back ears. Elegant, well balanced, moderately muscled, slender rather than massive in build.  They often appear well proportioned and balanced and can vary in size.
Personality
American Curls have qualities other than the whimsical ears that make them attractive pets. They are people cats who are rarely aloof and are affectionate without harassing their families for attention. They enjoy perching on laps and love to pat and nuzzle their family members. American Curls are oftentimes easily taught to play fetch and rarely lose their love of play. They often do very well with children. While not as active as the Abyssinian or Siamese, American Curls are plenty frisky and energetic. They also display the typical cat curiosity and want to be right there to investigate any changes in their home.

History
Expand History content
The American Curl originated in June 1981 as a spontaneous genetic mutation in the domestic cat population. They became popular in 1983, and by 1986 they were recognized by three of the largest North American cat registries.

In June 1981 two cats with ears that curled backwards arrived on the doorstep of a couple in Lakewood, California. One of the cats died shortly afterward, but the other, a friendly longhaired female, remained a member of the family and was named Shulamith.  At first, little attention was paid to Shulamith’s unique curled ears, her new family was more taken with her devotion and sweet trusting temperament. They assumed Shulamith was one of many curly-eared cats, even after visits to local libraries and book stores provided no mention of Shulamith’s supposed breed.

  <h2 id="two">Balinese</h2>
  <p>The Balinese is often a svelte cat with long tapering lines, very lithe but strong and muscular. The Balinese is unique with their distinct range of colors and silky coat that hides a supple and athletic body
  Personality
Since the Balinese and the Siamese are closely related, they share many traits. Like the Siamese, Balinese are curious, outgoing, intelligent cats with excellent communication skills. They are known for their chatty personalities and are always eager to tell you their views on life, love, and what you’ve served them for dinner. They often keep up a running monologue; they are not for those who think cats should be seen and not heard.

Balinese are often in tune with your moods and will be right there to cheer you up if you’re sad or to share your joy when you’re happy. Vocal themselves, they may respond to your tone of voice, and a scolding tone may hurt their sensitive feelings. A coaching tone and positive reinforcement are the only effective way for correcting unwanted behavior.

Balinese are agile and athletic, and if allowed will hitch a ride on the shoulder of any willing member of the family. They love to play and easily learn to fetch, bringing the ball or toy back for repeated throwing. They keep you entertained with their antics, but have a loving, devoted disposition as well. They can be quite assertive in their requests for attention, but also possess a special dignity particular to the Balinese and Siamese breeds.

History

In the early 1900s, longhaired kittens began appearing spontaneously in otherwise shorthaired Siamese litters. Some believe the recessive gene for long hair was introduced into the European Siamese gene pool after World War I. Since the Siamese was nearly obliterated during the war, other breeds and some mixed-breed domestic cats were used to revitalize the breed. The Turkish Angora, a breed with a silky semi-long fur similar to the Balinese coat, was thought to have been one of the breeds used.

Others believe that the recessive gene for long hair is simply a naturally occurring mutation. Both hypotheses have been disputed, and both have their reputable proponents, but no one really knows for sure. Regardless of how the long hair gene was acquired, the occasional longhair kittens were quietly given away.

In the 1940s, some people eventually thought these cats might be a good addition to the existing cat breeds. These longhaired cats began to be promoted and known as the Balinese. The Balinese name was intended to compare the cat’s graceful movements and flowing lines to those of the colorful dancers of Bali. In those early days, Balinese cats often had heavier boning and thicker coats than the Siamese.

By 1970, all major North American associations that existed at that time had accepted the Balinese. After the Balinese’s recognition, a color variant of this breed, the Javanese who was created by mixing the Balinese with the Colorpoint Shorthair, began to be promoted.  The Javanese combined the semi-long Balinese coat with the Colorpoint’s myriad of colors. The breed was named the Javanese after the Isle of Java, an island in Indonesia to the west of Bali. The Javanese isn’t from Java any more than the Balinese is from Bali, but it was believed that the name lent a nice romantic sound to the new breed.

On May 1, 2008, the Javanese officially became a color division of the Balinese, and in 2010 a single standard was adopted, fully combining the two breeds. In addition to sealpoint, chocolate point, blue point, and lilac point, the Balinese palette now includes twenty-two additional colors.

  <h2 id="three">Chartreux</h2>
  <p>
    The Chartreux is a sturdy, shorthaired French breed coveted in antiquity for its hunting prowess and its dense, water repellent fur. This breed’s husky, robust type is sometimes termed primitive, neither cobby nor classic. Though amply built, Chartreux are extremely supple and agile cats; refined, never coarse nor clumsy.
    Personality

Chartreux cats may have been invited in by monks to protect the monastery from rodents . Today, however, Chartreux cats are popular because they make terrific companions. Who can resist a cat that greets you with a mighty purr and an enigmatic smile? They are amiable, loyal, loving, and adaptable, and when you sit down next to your Chartreux, you invariably end up with an exquisitely soft lapful of adoring blue feline. Chartreux are the strong silent types of the cat fancy; they keep their comments to themselves, even when standing beside empty food dishes. Chartreux may open their mouths as if to meow, but no sound comes out. When they do vocalize, it’s usually with small chirps or trills—it’s amazing to hear tiny chirps come out of those large, powerful bodies and strong jaws. They do purr with the greatest enthusiasm, however, particularly when you’re serving up their favorite snack. In addition, quality time with their preferred persons always make them smile. Nevertheless, Chartreux cats have a quiet but well-developed sense of humor, and enjoy a good joke, particularly if it’s at your expense. Known for their hunting prowess and their strong hunting instinct, they love toys that move, preferably by human power. Feathered toys that whirl through the air are particular favorites. They easily learn to play fetch and enjoy frolicking with other felines and sometimes even an agreeable dog—and their human friends, of course. They are very intelligent cats; they quickly learn their names and if you like a good challenge you can even teach them to come when you call—if they’re in the mood, of course. This cat is the perfect feline friend; in return for a bowl of food, a clean litterbox, and a soft bed (yours) to sleep on, you get a constant companion that entertains, loves, and cheers you up with its angelic smile and sweet devotion.

The Chartreux (pronounced shär-TRUE), a true blue cat with a Mona Lisa smile and an amiable temperament, is France’s contribution to the cat fancy. Since the Chartreux has been around for so many centuries, it’s hard to say with certainty just where and when it first developed. Like most breeds with long histories, the Chartreux tale is the stuff of legends. The most popular account tells that the Chartreux was bred by monks at the Grande Chartreuse Monastery, the chief monastery of the Carthusian order, located north of Grenoble in southeastern France. As the story goes, the Carthusian order of monks at the monastery, in their spare time between praying, liqueur-making, and weapon-forging, bred Chartreux cats with the same skill and dedication with which they created their world-famous yellow and green Chartreuse liqueurs. Allegedly, they selectively bred the cats to have quiet voices so as not to disturb the monks’
